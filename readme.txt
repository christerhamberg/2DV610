This is a small project developing the base for a yatzy game TDD style.
Some parts of the design might not be the "best" possible but from an 
implementation point of view. But my aim is not to make the fanciest code possible
but rather do TDD and play around with testing components.

Each method added should result in a RED (Only test case done) push 
Following a GREEN (test case passed, i.e. there is also some code done) push
REFACTOR might be used if some code is cleaned up. Some additional comments might also be used.
